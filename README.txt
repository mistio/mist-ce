Mist.io helps you manage and monitor your virtual machines, across different
clouds, using any device that can access the web. It is provided under the

Installation
------------

Mist.io is written in Python. Currently it is tested and developed using
Python 2.7. The only system wide requirements are Python, Python header
files and some basic build tools. Git is used for revision control. Every other
dependency is build automatically via zc.buildout. Although we use zc.buildout
it is recommended to install mist.io in a virtualenv to avoid conflicts with
eggs in the system's Python.

To install the basic requirements in a Debian based distro do::

    sudo aptitude install python-dev build-essential git

If you wish to install it in a virtual environment you'll also need::

    sudo aptitude install python-virtualenv

In MacOSX you have to install Xcode and its command line tools. For virtualenv
you simply run::

    sudo easy_install virtualenv

In MacOSX there might be some problems with certificates. To solve the issue 
donwload a pem from http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html rename it to 
curl-ca-bundle.crt and save it to /opt/local/share/curl/ or to /usr/share/curl/ca-bundle.crt.

Supposing you have all the above, the steps are simple. Clone the repository,
create a virtualenv and run buildout::

    git clone https://github.com/mistio/mist.io.git
    cd mist.io
    virtualenv --no-site-packages .
    ./bin/python bootstrap.py
    ./bin/buildout -v

In case you are using an older version of setuptools, bootstrap will fail. To solve this you need to::

   ./bin/pip install setuptools --upgrade

Deployment
----------

Mist.io comes with two sets of deployment options, one suited for production
environments and one for develompent.

To get it up and running for production::

    ./bin/uwsgi-start production.ini

For development mode::

    ./bin/uwsgi-start development.ini

Or if you prefer to use paster::

    ./bin/paster serve development.ini --reload

With the --reload flag, whenever there are changes in Python code and templates
the server will automatically restart to load the new version. Changes in css
and javascript don't need a restart to show up. To stop it, simply press CTRL+C.
