## v3.0.0 (29 Apr 2018)

Major new release of the Mist Cloud Management Platform, Community Edition. 

The Community Edition now integrates with Telegraf & InfluxDB to provide a fully open source infrastructure management & monitoring stack. It also includes a revamped alerting & automation engine that will apply your rules to any group of machines. We enhanced the support of many clouds, most notably vSphere, GCE & OpenStack. It's now possible to bring together machines into a single virtual "Cloud". The usability and performance of the UI was greatly improved. At the same time we've remorselessly eliminated more than a few bugs.

A new plugin system was introduced, which is currently used by the Enterprise Edition and the Hosted Service to provide add-on functionality like i) Role Based Access Control, ii) Cost Insights, iii) VPN tunnels, iv) Orchestration of multi-tier architectures like Kubernetes clusters, as well as v) metering & billing extensions.

You can purchase the Mist Enterprise Edition and the Mist Hosted Service at https://mist.io
